feat: Implement dark mode and enhance UI/UX

This commit introduces a dark mode feature with a toggle button, improving the overall user experience.

Key changes include:
- **Dark Mode:** Added a dark mode with a toggle button in the sidebar, applying dark styles across the application (dashboard, archive, done, project detail, login, signup pages, and UI components like Card and ProgressBar).
- **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    - Fixed the restore button functionality on the archived tasks page.
    - Refined animations for smoother transitions using `framer-motion` and removed redundant Tailwind CSS transition classes.
    - Implemented intuitive "Enter" key behavior for new project creation: Enter in the title field moves focus to the description, and Enter in the description field creates the project.
    - Adjusted the weekly tasks completion button to prevent text overflow.
    - Ensured the weekly tasks "last done" display immediately updates to "0 days ago" upon completion.
- **Build Fixes:** Resolved build errors related to PostCSS configuration and missing `autoprefixer` module by updating `postcss.config.mjs` to use `import` statements and ensuring `autoprefixer` is installed.
