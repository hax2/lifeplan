feat: Implement comprehensive UI/UX improvements and bug fixes

This commit introduces a wide range of enhancements and fixes across the application:

1.  **Dark Mode & Color Palette Refinements:**
    -   Updated `src/app/globals.css` to adjust dark mode accent color and improve contrast for text and card backgrounds.
    -   Modified `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` to update the new project card color for better visual consistency in dark mode.

2.  **Reduced Motion Support:**
    -   Created `src/lib/useReducedMotion.ts` to detect user preference for reduced motion.
    -   Integrated `useReducedMotion` into `src/components/ui/ProgressBar.tsx` to animate the progress bar only when reduced motion is not preferred.

3.  **ARIA Attributes for Accessibility:**
    -   Added `role="progressbar"`, `aria-valuenow`, and `aria-valuemax` attributes to the progress bar in `src/components/ui/ProgressBar.tsx` for improved accessibility.

4.  **Skeleton Loading States:**
    -   Implemented skeleton loading components for `src/components/dashboard/DailyTasksWidget.tsx` and `src/components/dashboard/WeeklyTasksWidget.tsx` to provide better user feedback during data fetching.

5.  **Timezone-Safe Daily Task Queries:**
    -   Updated `src/app/api/daily-tasks/route.ts` to use `date-fns-tz` for accurate, timezone-safe daily task queries.
    -   Added `date-fns-tz` as a dependency in `package.json`.

6.  **Prisma Query Logging Control:**
    -   Configured `src/lib/prisma.ts` to log Prisma queries only in development environments, reducing noise in production logs.

7.  **Archive Widget Polling to SWR:**
    -   Refactored `src/app/dashboard/archive/page.tsx` to replace interval-based polling with `useSWR` for more efficient data fetching and real-time updates.
    -   Implemented optimistic updates for restore and delete operations in the archive widget.

8.  **Weekly Task Widget Improvements:**
    -   Ensured `lastCompletedAt` updates immediately in `src/components/dashboard/WeeklyTasksWidget.tsx` after a task is completed.
    -   Implemented optimistic UI updates for new weekly tasks in `src/components/dashboard/WeeklyTasksWidget.tsx`.

9.  **Responsive Sidebar (Partial Implementation):**
    -   Added initial setup for a responsive sidebar in `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`.
    -   *Note: Full implementation of the responsive sidebar requires a Dialog component, which is not currently available in the project's dependencies. Further action is needed to integrate a suitable Dialog component or implement an alternative responsive solution.*
