Analysis of Build Errors

The build process failed due to the following issues:

    Missing Component Imports: The DailyTasksWidget.tsx and WeeklyTasksWidget.tsx files are attempting to use a Card component without importing it first.

    Invalid Import Statements: The archive/page.tsx file has import statements placed incorrectly inside the component function, which is a syntax error. It also contains duplicate imports.

Step-by-Step Fixes

Here are the precise instructions to resolve each error:
1. Fix DailyTasksWidget.tsx

    File: src/components/dashboard/DailyTasksWidget.tsx

    Problem: The Card component is used but not imported.

    Solution: Add the following import statement to the top of the file, alongside the other imports:

Generated javascript

      
import { Card } from "../ui/Card";

    

2. Fix WeeklyTasksWidget.tsx

    File: src/components/dashboard/WeeklyTasksWidget.tsx

    Problem: Similar to the daily tasks widget, the Card component is used without being imported.

    Solution: Add the following import statement to the top of the file:

Generated javascript

      
import { Card } from "../ui/Card";

3. Fix archive/page.tsx

    File: src/app/dashboard/archive/page.tsx

    Problem: This file has duplicate and misplaced import statements for useSWR and useProjectStore. Imports must be at the top level of the file.

    Solution: Clean up the import section at the top of the file.

Replace this entire block of imports:
Generated javascript

      
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Project } from '@/lib/types';
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
import toast from 'react-hot-toast';
import { RotateCcw, Trash2 } from 'lucide-react';
import { useProjectStore } from '@/lib/store';

import useSWR from 'swr';
import { useProjectStore } from '@/lib/store';

    


With this corrected and de-duplicated block:
Generated javascript

      
'use client';

import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
import toast from 'react-hot-toast';
import { RotateCcw, Trash2 } from 'lucide-react';
import useSWR from 'swr';
import { useProjectStore } from '@/lib/store';
import { Project } from '@/lib/types';

    


After applying these three fixes, the build should succeed.
